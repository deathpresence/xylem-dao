# Welcome to Xylem DAO

Xylem DAO is a Bitcoin L1-native, decentralized stablecoin protocol.

Xylem Protocol and its stablecoin USDx will be an overcollateralized primitive for Bitcoin-native DeFi, managed natively on BTC via the XYM token.

Recent innovations in Bitcoin programmability have enabled BTC-Fi to begin closing the gap between Bitcoin and its EVM competitors. This allows for the possibility of a stablecoin backed by **native** BTC for the first time; hence, USDx, the stablecoin managed by Xylem DAO, is over 130% collateralized with BTC.

Bitcoin Runes will tokenize Xylem, and governance will be enabled via distributed consensus based on the indexer stats of Xylem votes.
