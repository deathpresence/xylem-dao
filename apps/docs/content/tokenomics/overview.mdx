# Tokenomics

Xylem DAO operates with a dual-token model similar to Maker DAO, with each token serving distinct functions within the ecosystem.

# USDx

USDx is Xylem's stablecoin, designed to maintain a soft peg to the US Dollar. Key characteristics:

- **Overcollateralized**: Each USDx is backed by at least 130% in BTC value
- **Price Stability**: Soft-pegged to 1 USD
- **Utility**: Functions as a stable medium of exchange and store of value in the Bitcoin ecosystem
- **Minting**: Created when users lock BTC collateral in vaults
- **Burning**: Destroyed when users repay their debt positions

# XYM

XYM is the governance token that gives holders voting rights on protocol parameters and decisions. Key characteristics:

- **Governance Rights**: Token holders can vote on risk parameters, protocol upgrades, and treasury allocations
- **Value Accrual**: XYM captures value through system surplus
- **Supply Dynamics**: Deflationary mechanism through buy-and-burn model
- **Protocol Security**: Serves as recapitalization resource in extreme cases

# USDx Utility
- **Stability**: Provides a stable unit of account within the Bitcoin ecosystem
- **Liquidity**: Enables efficient capital allocation and trading in BTC markets
- **Transaction Medium**: Facilitates easier commerce compared to volatile BTC
- **DeFi Integration**: Serves as building block for other Bitcoin-native DeFi applications

# XYM Utility
- **Governance Voting**: Weight of votes proportional to token holdings
- **Protocol Fee Accrual**: XYM holders benefit from protocol revenues
- **Economic Security**: Final backstop for system solvency
- **Protocol Upgradeability**: Enables progressive enhancement of the system

# Stability Fees
Users who create USDx by opening vaults pay stability fees, similar to Maker DAO's model:
- Stability fees are charged continuously on outstanding debt
- Fees are collected in USDx
- A portion of stability fees (50%) goes to the Reserve
- Remaining fees are used to buy and burn XYM tokens, creating deflationary pressure

# Liquidation Fees
When vaults are liquidated:
- 15% liquidation fee is applied
- Fees distributed between Reserve and liquidators
- Creates economic incentives for liquidators to maintain system solvency

# Buy and Burn Mechanism
- Protocol revenue not allocated to the Reserve is used to purchase XYM tokens
- Purchased tokens are burned, reducing total supply
- Creates sustainable value accrual for XYM holders

# Token Distribution

The initial XYM token distribution is designed to align incentives across all stakeholders:

- **Core Contributors**: 20%
  - 3-year vesting schedule with 1-year cliff
- **Xylem Foundation**: 15%
  - Reserved for long-term development and ecosystem growth
- **Protocol Treasury**: 10%
  - Controlled by governance for future initiatives
- **Initial Liquidity & Bootstrapping**: 35%
  - Incentivizes early adopters and ensures market depth
- **Community Allocation**: 20%
  - Airdrops, grants, and ecosystem building

# Governance Power

XYM token holders can vote on various protocol parameters (similar to MKR holders in Maker DAO):

1. Risk parameters (collateralization ratios, liquidation thresholds)
2. Technical upgrades to protocol components
3. Onboarding new validators
4. Treasury allocations
5. Emergency shutdown authorization

# Bootstrapping Strategy

The initial bootstrapping of the protocol involves:

1. **Liquidity Mining**: Early vault creators receive XYM rewards
2. **Incentivized Liquidations**: Extra XYM rewards for early liquidators
3. **Validator Staking**: Rewards for validators who maintain the network
4. **Integration Partnerships**: Allocations for protocols that integrate USDx

# Long-term Sustainability

Like Maker DAO, Xylem is designed for long-term sustainability:

- **Revenue Sharing**: Protocol profits distributed between Reserve and token holders
- **Treasury Diversification**: BTC reserves maintained for system resilience
- **Governance Minimization**: Progressive decentralization of protocol control
- **Risk Management**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment of risk parameters

The Xylem tokenomics model builds on lessons learned from Maker DAO while adapting to the unique characteristics of the Bitcoin L1 environment.
