Certain statements herein may constitute forward-looking statements. When used herein, the words "may," "will," "should," "project," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "expect," "continue," and similar expressions or the negatives thereof are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements, including the intended actions and performance objectives of Xylem, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that could cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of Xylem in its development of the system, network, its components, and the tokens to differ materially from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

No representation or warranty is made as to future performance or such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements herein speak only as of the date hereof. Xylem expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in its expectation with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

You are not to construe this documentation as investment, legal, tax, regulatory, financial, accounting or other advice, and this documentation is not intended to provide the basis for any evaluation of an investment in an interest. The XYM token will not be offered in the United States or to U.S. persons, or to residents of certain other prohibited jurisdictions.

# Experimental Nature

The Xylem protocol is highly experimental. USDx is designed to be a **highly experimental** overcollateralized algorithmic unit of stable account, soft-pegged to approximately one US Dollar, conditional on the market constraints of USDx supply, USDx demand, and USDx's Bitcoin overcollateralization. 

Nothing stated herein should EVER be construed as a guarantee or pledge that a USDx token will equal a US Dollar under all or even most circumstances. 

If the Xylem Protocol does not balance supply and demand for USDx as expected, or if other unforeseen issues de-link USDx with Protocol members' BTC collateral, your USDx may be exposed to material loss, and your XYM tokens may be rendered worthless.

# Development Status

The Xylem protocol is under development and is subject to change. As such, the protocol documentation and contents of this document may not reflect the current state of the protocol at any given time. The protocol documentation, document, and website content are not final and are subject to change.
